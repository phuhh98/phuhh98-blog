# Ditch the Calculator, Share the Bill with Ease!

Ever found yourself drowning in receipts after a group grocery run or a big restaurant outing? Trying to split the bill fairly can feel like solving a complex math problem, especially when everyone grabbed a bunch of different items. Well, say goodbye to those awkward calculations and hello to Sharebill, the app that makes splitting bills a breeze!

I've been working on this little project, and I'm excited to finally share it with you. Sharebill is designed to simplify the process of dividing expenses, whether it's for groceries, restaurant bills, or anything where you're splitting the cost of multiple items.

## How does it work?

Glad you asked! It's super simple:

1. Upload your receipt: Just snap a picture of your receipt or select one from your gallery. Sharebill uses some clever technology to extract the items and prices.

2. Add your payers: Input the names of everyone who's chipping in.
3. Divide and conquer: Assign items to specific payers. Sharebill will automatically calculate everyone's share.

## Behind the Scene

Sharebill isn't just a pretty face! It's powered by some cool tech, including Python, React, and Ant Design for the user interface. And for the smarts? I've leveraged the power of LangChain and a little help from Gemini AI to make the receipt processing and calculations smooth and efficient.
